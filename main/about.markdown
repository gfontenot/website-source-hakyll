A native Texan, I fell in love with programming in high school, and made it a
career in adulthood.

Currently, I get paid to write [Swift] and (begrudgingly), [Objective-C] for
[thoughtbot].  For some reason, they also keep letting me pretend to write
[Haskell].

I'm traveling the country right now, spending a month in various US cities
before settling in Austin, TX. I'm currently living in Portland.

I root for [Houston Astros][astros], and lift weights at whatever CrossFit gym
is closest to my Airbnb.
