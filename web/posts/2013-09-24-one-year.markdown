On March 23rd, 2010, I was in a bar with a couple of my friends. After a
couple of beers, I began ranting about how I wanted an app on iPhone OS that
could help me keep track of the beers I was drinking, along with tasting notes
and ratings. It's possible that I had maybe one beer too many, but when one of
my friends suggested that I just build the app myself, I laughed it off and
went on with my night. But when I woke up in the morning, it was still there
in the back of my head. So on March 24th, 2010, I opened Xcode, started a
project from a template, and started teaching myself Objective-C.

What I knew I'd get out of that project was a silly hobby that might make a
few dollars. What I hoped for was a basic understanding about how to make
applications, and maybe a nice challenge for weekend hacking. What I ended up
with was a career change, and a newfound passion.

1 year ago today, I started as a professional iOS developer at [thoughtbot][]
in Boston, MA. In that past year, I have grown tenfold professionally. I
started attending [my local CocoaHeads chapter][cocoaheads] in January, and
attended my [first professional conference][nsnorth] in April. In June I
attended my first [WWDC][] ... [kinda][altwwdc]. And at the end of July, I
started to [co-host a podcast][buildphase] with my good friend and colleague,
[Mark Adams][].

It's been a hell of a fucking year. I've been almost unbelievably lucky over
the past 12 months. [My co-workers][tb-about] are easily the smartest group of
people I have ever met in my entire life. The projects I have been able to
work on have been incredible learning experiences that have forced me to
become a better developer on a daily basis. And for the first time in my life,
I'm working in a job that I'm proud to call a career.

Can't wait to see what happens next.
