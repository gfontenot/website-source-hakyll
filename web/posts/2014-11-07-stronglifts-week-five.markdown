Went to a new gym today and couldn't find the squat rack. Had to do my squats
in a 3D Smith machine, which was a complete and utter waste of time. How the
hell do people use those things? I couldn't find info on how much the bar
weighed, but I seriously doubt it was 45lbs. So that's a fairly questionable
195 for today. I'm going to push ahead and do 200 on Monday because I'm not
that worried about it, but it's frustrating to feel like I wasted a workout.
