title: Making Time for Side Projects
tags: development, life
---

I have about a million things I'd like to do at any given moment. If I sit
down and try to choose something to spend my time on, it's fairly
overwhelming. There are blog posts I could write, books I could read, movies
and TV shows I could watch, or any number of ways I could continue my own
education via videos or articles. And then there are the side projects. So so
many side projects.

The problem with side projects is that you can't complete them. No matter what
you think, side projects aren't done[^1]. You might be able to finish reading a
book or watching a run of a TV show, but you'll never finish that "small" tool
you've been meaning to write. There will _always_ be something to improve,
something to tweak, something to fix.

I decided a while ago to write my own microblog. This "small" app was supposed
to serve two different purposes:

1. To take back ownership of my writing and host it under my own domain and
   in my own database.
2. To act as an excuse to learn [Yesod] so that I could start on my _real_
   side project.

[My microblog][featureless-void] is now 7 months old and has seen [133
commits][featureless-void-commits] to master (at the time of this writing) and
isn't _close_ to being "finished". And this isn't even the thing I _want_ to
work on as my side project. I've spent so much time working on The Small Thing
that I've barely even _started_ on The Real Thing.

So, presented with infinite things to do, an infinite amount of time that
those things will take up, and a spectacularly finite amount of time to do
them: how the shit do I actually get things done?

The solution I'm going to experiment with is to explicitly set aside a part of
my week that I tend to otherwise "waste"[^2], and dedicate it to working on a
side project. For me, this means Sunday mornings (before noon). I expect
_most_ of that time to be spent working on my main side project (a workout
tracking app I'm currently calling Swole), but I'm also not going to stop
myself from working on projects like [my microblog][featureless-void], [my
dotfiles][dotfiles], or [any][reflow] of [my][argo] other [open][runes] source
[projects][swish] if they should catch my interest that week. The important
thing here is not necessarily the specific project I work on, but is instead
to be strict with myself about stopping at noon and not letting that time
spill over into the rest of the day, or the rest of the week. By limiting
myself to this specific sliver of time, I hope to see myself be able to focus
on my project when I need to, and ignore it during the rest of the week.

[^2]: I firmly believe there's no such thing as "wasted" time, just time
  that's spent with a different set of priorities. See the venerable Merlin
  Mann's post [Mud Rooms, Red Letters, and Real
  Priorities](http://www.43folders.com/2009/04/28/priorities) for more on
  "priorities".

[runes]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/Runes
[swish]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/Swish

As an added bonus here, the short time frame _should_ present itself well to
learning (or implementing) small, specific bits of functionality. My hope is
that these weekly experiments will easily translate into blog posts on the
subject, which will help me improve my writing habits.
