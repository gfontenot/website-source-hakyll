Wrapped up the first week of StrongLifts 5x5 this morning. These weights felt
super light, but I'm trying to stick with the program as it's outlined. With
this program, I should be adding 5lbs to each movement every time I do them,
so (hopefully) it won't be too long before the volume catches up. It really is
fun squatting this much, and I'm excited to do deadlifts at least once a week,
as opposed to the once a month I was doing them before.
